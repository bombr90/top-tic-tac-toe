The Oden Project Assignment: Tic-Tac-Toe

A basic tic-tac-toe game heavily relying on Javascript with a 
small amount of html and css.

Version 1.0 
Satsifys assignment requirements. Future implementation of minmax
"computer" algorithm to take over for user who manually plays the 
"computer". Plan to add some more styling (eg. 'winStreak' to 
highlight winning combo).
